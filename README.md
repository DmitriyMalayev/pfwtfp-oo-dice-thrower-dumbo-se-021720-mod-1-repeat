# Advanced Dice Thrower

## Learning Goals

- Create object oriented dice thrower application

## Introduction

In our previous dice thrower labs, we've gone through the process of creating
a variety of dice rolling methods and game-like conditions. We can take the
existing methods and break them into 2 separate classes: One for `Dice` and one
for `GameConditions`. 

## Create Object Oriented Dice Thrower Application
`throw_die`
`generate_set`
`generate_hash_set`
`lucky_number_seven`
`throw_variable_die`

## Conclusion

We've gone through a series of exercises that show us the process for creating
reusable and maintainable code.
